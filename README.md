This project is an e-commerce store built using React, aimed at applying knowledge of React and creating a functional e-commerce website. It utilizes the API provided at https://api.noroff.dev/api/v1/online-shop for retrieving product data.

## Functions and Features

Homepage: This page displays a list of all products available in the store. It includes a look-ahead search bar that filters products based on the user's input. Clicking on a product takes the user to the individual product page.

Individual product page: This page shows the details of a single product. It includes the product's title, description, image, and any available reviews. The page also displays the price of the product, taking into account any discounts. Users can add the product to their cart from this page.

Cart page: The cart page displays a list of all products added to the cart. It also shows the total price of all items in the cart. Users can proceed to checkout from this page.

Checkout success page: After a successful checkout, this page displays a message notifying the user about their order. It provides a link to go back to the store, and the cart is cleared.

Contact page: The contact page includes a contact form with fields for full name, subject, email, and body. The form has validation requirements, and once the form data meets the validation criteria, it is logged to the console.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
